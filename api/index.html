The Command Line Interface (CLI) of ImageMgaick which this examples deals with
is only one method by which you can use, modify and control images with the
core library of ImageMagick functions (MagickCore). It is basically the
'shell' API interface.  There are lots of other Application Programming
Interfaces (API's) which you can use more directly from many programming
languages, see <A HREF="https://imagemagick.org/script/api.php"
>ImageMagick APIs</A>. </P>

Here I look at ways of improving your IM scripting and programming,
differences between Windows and Unix scripting, and look at basics of using IM
from other API's and programming languages. </P>

<HR><!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<A NAME="api"></A>
<H2>APIs and other IM usage methods</H2>

API's (Application Programming Interface) for actual image processing are in
fact no faster than using the CLI commands (such as "<CODE>convert</CODE>"
(which is itself represents a type of shell-API).  The same 'core' library is
used for all image processing in IM.  So if you are doing a complex task such
as image distortion, using an API over a the shell "<CODE>convert</CODE>" makes
very little difference in terms of overall 'speed' of processing. </P>

<I>So why use an API over Command line?</I></P>

A shell constantally 'forks' off many different commands (not just IM
"<CODE>convert</CODE>" commands, though shells have some 'built-ins'), each of
which has to be loaded, and initialised every time it is run. </P>

Every IM command also has to re-initialise its configuration files, parse the
command line arguments, re-read whatever images you are working with, and
often save results back to disk.  All of which takes time causing them to be
slower.  </P>

That is all that extra steps take time and processing power, so if you do it
a lot, and API can start to make sense. </P>

API can also allow you to do other things a command line can't. <UL>
<LI>If the API is already running, you have little to no setup time.
<LI>Store in memory an array of many image lists that can be processed in any
    order you like. For example I have a program that reads in hundreds of
    images, thumbnailing them as 32x32 pixel images as it reads them, them
    compares them all in pairs one pair at a time (9,900 compares for 100
    images). Another would be to say sort images by general color in memory!
<LI>You can be doing many difference threads of image processing, in any order.
    You do not have to 'finish' one sequence of processing before working on
    the next image or step. For example imagine a program that solves a jigsaw
    puzzle!
<LI>You can retrieve information from images, and use that information in
    complex ways to modify image processing without having to re-initialise
    the image processing (re-reading configs and images) over and over.  For
    example get the image size beform working out the framing requirements for
    the image.
<LI>Looping though images, doing something very different with each and every
    image! For example generating an animation sequence, with each frame
    distorted in a slightly different way.
<LI>Direct and completely random access to the image data.  For example
    looking for a 'face' in an image.
</UL></P>

But for most things not involving large numbers of images, or general
procesing of images in well defined ways, the command line is pretty well just
as fast. You can however save lot ot time and re-processing by... <UL>

<LI>Make use of <A HREF="../files/#mpc" >MPC Image Saving</A> (for faster
    re-reads) of intermediate images.. See my script <A
    HREF="../scripts/divide_vert" >divide_vert</A>
<LI>Paralleled processing using pipe-lining (even using different machines
    for different steps!), to make better processor use and avoid saving
    intermedite images to disk.  See <A HREF="../scripts/enlarge_image"
    >enlarge_image</A> for a pipelined script example with one step piping the
    image(s) into the next (sometimes optional) step in the sequence.
<LI>Use a loop to process each image individually, before piping a magick stream of
    image results into a final 'merge them all' step.  I have many scripts
    like this...  See <A HREF="../layers/#layer_prog" >Programmed Prossition
    of Layered Images</A> for one such script.
</UL></P>

Of course in an API you also have different and faster techniques could also
have been used for a special processing task that would make access to the
image.  And as we find and get time we often program such techniques into the
core library.   Image distortions and various FX expressions is one example of
this. </P>

<A NAME="windows"></A>
<H3>Windows, and DOS</H3>

The examples on using Windows and DOS scripting using the CLI API, has been
moved to <A HREF="../windows/" >Usage under Windows</A>.


<A NAME="php"></A>
<H3>PHP
<FONT SIZE=-1>(IM commands from "<CODE>system()</CODE>" functions)</FONT></H3>

PHP users have three ways of using ImageMagick, <UL>
<LI>The "<CODE>imagick</CODE> PECL interface
<LI>The "<CODE>MagicWand</CODE>" interface
<LI>Using "system()" and "exec()" functions to run the CLI
    "<CODE>convert</CODE>" command.
</UL>

Because of the existence of <A HREF="../" >IM Examples</A> this later method
(and the first we will look at next) has in recent years become the most
common method of using IM from PHP. </P>

Of course for some things it may not be the best method (see above), in which
case the API interfaces is available, though may require a system
administrator to make them available to your PHP environment. </P>

<A NAME="php_shell"></A>
<H4>PHP using Shell Commands</H4>

The best source of specific information on using this technique is the IM
forum user <I><A HREF="../forum_link.cgi?u=6256" >Bonzo</A></I> and his web
site <A HREF="http://www.rubblewebs.co.uk/imagemagick/imagemagick.php"
>RubbleWebs</A>. </P>

Please note, PHP runs "<CODE>convert</CODE>" using a different environment,
and probably even as a different user, to what you would get from the command
line.  As such what works on the command line, may take a little tweaking to
get it to work from a PHP web driven script. </P>

The following is the recommend procedure for initial tests of an ISP's command
line IM interface, assuming you do not have direct command line 'shell' access
on the remote system.  That is you can only upload web files for execution.
</P>

So the first thing we need to do is try and find the "<CODE>convert</CODE>"
command on the system, what version is installed, and the environment the PHP
is running. </P>

On a Linux Web Service, upload and access this PHP script from the ISP's web
server...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
&lt;?php
  header('Content-Type: text/plain');
  system("exec 2>&amp;1; pwd");
  system("exec 2>&amp;1; type convert");
  system("exec 2>&amp;1; locate */convert");
  system("exec 2>&amp;1; magick -version");
  system("exec 2>&amp;1; magick -list type"); &lt;!-- before IM v6.3.5-7 --&gt;
  system("exec 2>&amp;1; magick -list font");
  print("------ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES-------\n");
  system("exec 2>&amp;1; env");
?&gt;
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

This will run quite a number of commands to see what your environment is like.
</P>

The first "<CODE>pwd</CODE>" tells you the current directory in which the PHP
script was run.  This may or may not be the directory where the PHP script is
located, and you may not be able to write in that directory form the PHP
script. </P>

The next two commands tells you if "<CODE>convert</CODE>" is available on the
default provided command PATH using "<CODE>type</CODE>", and if so where is
it.  The "<CODE>locate</CODE>" command should find all "<CODE>convert</CODE>"
commands that exists on the server (assuming it is a linux server), but may
find other non-ImageMagick "<CODE>convert</CODE>" commands, files and
directories. You will need to interpret the results. </P>

The next three commands, assume "<CODE>convert</CODE>" is on the command PATH,
and asks it to report its version number, and what fonts IM think it has
access to. Which command reports what fonts depends on how old the installed
IM version is. </P>

If you only see errors, then the "<CODE>convert</CODE>" is not on the command
line path,  and your ISP provider did NOT initialise the web server
"<CODE>PATH</CODE>" and "<CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>" properly to include it.
See output from the "<CODE>env</CODE>" command for what they did define.  </P>

If this is the case you will need to find out exactly where it is located and
use something like the following PHP script. This will make your script less
portable, as it is hard coded for that specific ISP. </P>

For example suppose the "<CODE>convert</CODE>" command is in
"<CODE>/opt/php5extras/ImageMagick/bin</CODE>", then you can set a variable to
specify its location.  This is often done as part of application configuration
and installation process, for PHP scripts being used on different ISP hosts),

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
&lt;?php
  $im_path="/opt/php5extras/ImageMagick/bin"
  header('Content-Type: text/plain');
  system("exec 2>&1; $im_path/magick -version");
  system("exec 2>&1; $im_path/magick -list type");
  system("exec 2>&1; $im_path/magick -list font");
?&gt;
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

If you get "<CODE>ldd</CODE>" library errors, the
"<CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>" is wrong, and the ISP has definitely fallen
down on the job during its installation, and you need to report the error, and
have them fix the web servers "<CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>" environment
variable setting, or re-install ImageMagick.  </P>

Rather than set the location of the magick command, you can also adjust the
PATH environment variable with a line such as this at the top. However this
method is often 'denied' by default by typical PHP system configuration...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >

</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

After that try some of the simpler examples from IM Examples and try to get
them working.  For example output the IM 'rose' image as a JPEG image file
back to the web user...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
&lt;?php
  header( 'Content-Type: image/jpeg' );
  passthru("magick rose:  jpg:-");
?&gt;
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

If you need to set the magick command location you can use...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
&lt;?php
  header( 'Content-Type: image/jpeg' );
  $convert="/opt/php5extras/ImageMagick/bin/convert"
  passthru("$magick rose:  jpg:-");
?&gt;
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

or if the you have library problems you can try something like...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
&lt;?php
  header( 'Content-Type: image/jpeg' );

  $libs="LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\'" .  $_ENV["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"] .
               ":/opt/php5extras/ImageMagick/bin/convert\'";
  system("$libs $magick rose:  jpg:-");
?&gt;
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>

If you still don't see anything look at my raw <A

</P>

<BR>

When you have that basic script working you can try one of the fonts listed
from your PHP test scripts (modify the following to suit your PHP server).
</P>

For example on a Solaris Server I had available at this time, I noticed that
the '<CODE>Utopia</CODE>' font set was available so I was able to try to
create a label with that font...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
&lt;?php
  header('Content-Type: image/gif');
  passthru("magick -pointsize 72 -font Utopia-Italic label:'Font Test' gif:-");
?&gt;
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

<A NAME="php_example"></A>
<H4>Example Shell to PHP conversion</H4>

Here we have a fairly typical ImageMagick command...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
  magick -background none -fill red -gravity center \
          -font Candice -size 140x92 caption:"A Rose by any Name" \
          \( rose: -negate -resize 200% \) +swap -magick composite    output.gif
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

When converting to PHP it will become something like...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
&lt;?php
  header('Content-Type: image/gif');

  $color="red";
  $image="rose:";
  $scale="200%";
  $size="140x96";
  $string="A Rose by any Name";

  passthru( "magick -background none -fill '$color' -gravity center" .
            " -font Candice -size '$size' caption:'$string'" .
            " \\( '$image' -negate -resize '$scale' \\) +swap -composite" .
            " gif:-" );
?&gt;
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

Note how I still split up the long command line of the "<CODE>convert</CODE>"
command to make the image processing sequence easier to follow, and to edit
later.  This was done using PHP appended strings rather than the shell line
continuation used in shell scripts. </P>

Also note the extra space at the start of later lines.  And doubling up the
other backslashes that was present in the original command.  Alternatively you
can protect those options by using single quotes instead of backslashes.  </P>

I also used some PHP variables to allow easier adjusted of the PHP script
image generated, to provide better control the results. However when I insert
those options in the "<CODE>convert</CODE>" I used single quotes to protect
them from further modification by the shell.  But watch out for single quotes
within those inserted strings!  </P>

You could make those options PHP input arguments, so you can generate an image
for any input text passed to it from a web request. </P>

You can also perform multiple shell commands from within the same system call
string.  In fact a single system call can contain a complete shell script if
you want!  So you can do shell loops and multiple commands (with cleanups) all
in the one system call. Something not may people realise is possible. </P>

Basically if you are careful, you can make good use of the mathematics
provided by PHP, and the scripting abilities of the shell. All at the same
time.  Just watch the quotes. </P>

For various examples of calling ImageMagick commands from PHP see <A
HREF="http://www.rubblewebs.co.uk/imagemagick/basics/explain.php" >Rubble
Web, Writing IM code in PHP</A>  which describes about four different
techniques. </P>

<A NAME="php_quotes"></A>
<H4>Watch the extra quotes</H4>

Note that typically the IM commands in PHP are wrapped by an extra set of
quotes (usually double quotes), as such care must be taken to allow for the
use of these extra level of quoting.

Remember when PHP executes a string.... </P>

<B>PHP</B> does its quotes, backslash and variable substitutions </P>

<B>Shell</B> then splits up arguments and does its own variable and quote
substitutions.  It will also do any "2&gt;&amp;1" type file descriptor
redirections if present. </P>

<B>ImageMagick</B> gets an argument array, but will also do its own filename
meta-character handling specifically for DOS (the dos environment doesn't
handle meta-chars) and for arguments such as coder:*.gif[50x50]  which the
shell fails to expand due to coder: prefix or the [...] read modifier. </P>

That is a LOT of argument parsing! Whcih can mean a lot of quoting and
backslashing handling.   <I>Caution and fore-thought is required</I>. </P>

I recommend you at least read the PHP manuals on <A
HREF="http://php.net/manual/en/ref.exec.php" >Program Execution Functions</A>,
which includes: <A HREF="http://php.net/function.system" >PHP exec()</A>, <A
HREF="http://php.net/function.exec" >system()</A>, and <A
HREF="http://php.net/function.passthru" >passthru()</A>. also look at the <A
HREF="http://au2.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.execution.php" >Backtick
Operator</A>.  Of particular importance, understand what exactly is returned
(generally the last line only) and passed on to the calling client (everything
else). </P>

<A NAME="php_security"></A>
<H4>PHP Security</H4>

Remember...
<DIV ALIGN=center><PRE><I>
   On the net, the only users you can trust not to be potentially hostile
   are those who are  *activally*  hostile.
                                     -- Programming Perl - Camel Book, r3
</I></PRE></DIV></P>

You must throughly check all input arguments being passed from user to
an IM command troughly.  Make sure the argument is exactly what you expect.
It is far better to be over restrictive that under restrictive when
dealing with the World Wide Web. </P>

Some common things to watch out for include <UL>
<LI> Binary characters in argument  - a common cracker technqiue
<LI> Unexpected spaces, tabs, newlines and returns in arguments.
<LI> Backslashes (directory seperators), and '<CODE>..</CODE>' paths,
     Also under windows '<CODE>\</CODE>' and '<CODE>;</CODE>' in filenames.
<LI> File Expansion Meta-characters including
     "<CODE>~*?[]{}&lt;&gt;</CODE>" plus the special "<CODE>@</CODE>"
     meta-character specific to ImageMagick.
<LI> Other shell meta-characters including  "<CODE>$#;</CODE>" and the
     three quote character '<CODE>'</CODE>', '<CODE>"</CODE>', '<CODE>`</CODE>'
<LI> Argument does not match what ImageMagick expects. Use
     "<CODE><A HREF="../option_link.cgi?list" >-list</A></CODE>"
     to read what types of argument IM does understand for specific
     options.  For example an user input "<CODE><A
     HREF="../option_link.cgi?gravity" >-gravity</A></CODE>" option, only has
     10 different settings.
<LI> And so on...
</UL>

For any sort of web programming work, an understanding of security and how
hackers can use specially crafted arguemnts to subvert called commands, is
vital.  Not just for PHP, but for Shell, and ImageMagick. </P>

IM requires particular care as it can for example read and magick a password
file into an image to be returned.

Again... It is far better to be overly restrictive, than open an unforseen
security hole, when the web is involved. </P>


<H4>Writing to the Filesystem</H4>

As mentioned above, and if you followed the above initial proceedure, you will
know for certain, PHP generally runs as a different. more resctritive user on
the server. </P>

Because of this it will typicall NOT be able to write to the directory
containing the script (or where ever it is actually running. For security
reasons you generally <B>do not want to write to that directory</B>! </P>

If you really want PHP to write files, have it save the image (or data) to
an unique filename in "<CODE>/tmp</CODE>",  and above all <B>clean up
afterward</B>, on both normal exit, or on ANY error. It is amazing how quickly
you can fill a disk with left over temporary files from an application that
does not cleanup properly. </P>

If the saved files (images) must be visible by the web server, make a special
'write by program' sub-directory, for those files. </P>

<B>How it should be done. </B></P>

Most PHP applications actually avoid writing anything to the file system by
using a database backend.  That is cookies, tokens, user data, images, and so
on are all written into a database, such as (in order of complexity and scale)
SQLite, PostgresSQL, MySQL, and Oracle.  It saves nothing in the filesystem at
all.  System Programmers will typically configure the PHP application with
that information when the application is installed. </P>

Images is typically reproduced by either the same, or separate PHP script that
looks up the image 'blob' and outputs it to the client.  Images may be sent as
'inline' images with the HTML itself (see, the "<CODE><A
HREF="../files/#inline" >inline:</A></CODE>" format, which has a demonstration
of HTML inline images), or as a single 'all in one' multiple image, so the
client HTML/JAVA only has one image reqest rather than 20 separate requests.
</P>

One final point.  Some method of cleaning up old data should always be
present.  An user that has not logged in for 2 year, probably should have his
data deleted. </P>

<H4>More Secure ImageMagick Commands...</H4>

Idealy for security reasons, you would want to avoid using the shell to parse
a single long string into separate command and arguments. It is better to do
it yourself!  This mean you provide the arguments to the command as an array
of separate strings, instead of as an one single shell-parsed string. </P>

By doing this you prevent the posibility of shell syntax errors, the extra
quoting burden needed by the shell, and prevent the posiblity of some hacker
breaking the shell command and runing there own command (very bad). </P>

On the other hand you loose shell scripting, piping, and file re-direction,
but that is typically not a great loss when you are already using PHP or some
other wrapping language. </P>

In PHP the only function I could find that will let me call command directly
without a shell is the  <A HREF="http://php.net/function.pcntl-exec"
>pcntl_exec()</A> function.  This basically avoids shell, and calls the
command directly. </P>

However it is a true 'execl()' system call, which replaces the current process
with the command given.  That is it does not do the 'fork()' and file
descriptor linkages, needed to run it as a sub-process.  As such <A
HREF="http://php.net/function.pcntl-exec" >pcntl_exec()</A> is really after
too low level for generate use, and implementing a 'no-shell' command can get
get fairly complex. </P>

I am very surprised a simpler, more secure 'avoid the shell' command call has
not already been provided by the PHP interface.  But then I am not a PHP
programmer.  Perl on the other hand provides a number of method of securly
calling sub-commands and processes, which often makes it more preferable as
a web interface than PHP. </P>

<I>Anyone with PHP security knowledge care to enlighten or provide pointers to
more information?</I> </P>

<H4>Complex PHP scripts...</H4>

If you need to generate and output both HTML and IMAGES, consider designing
your PHP script so that separate HTML requests or input options, generate the
various parts you need on your web document, from either the same, or
different PHP scripts.  </P>

That is a top level PHP script can output HTML with appropriate &lt;IMG&gt;
tags, that call itself (or another PHP script) with appropriate options, to
create or modify the images displayed on the first top level PHP script.  This
is in what a lot of photo album, and graphing PHP scripts do.   All controlled
by the GET, and PATH_INFO extensions to the URL calls. Note that you can not
use POST within an IMG tag. </P>

By doing things in this way you should be able to completely avoid the need to
both generate, save, and clean-up, temporary images for PHP generated web
pages.  A solution that is full of problems, such as resource limitations and
garbage collection, making it a very bad programming technique. </P>

This technique looked at in both the <A
HREF="https://imagemagick.org/script/index.php#books" >ImageMagick
Books</A>, though the ImageMagick it actually uses is becomming a little
dated.  </P>

<HR><!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<A NAME="perlmagick"></A>
<H3>Perl Magick Scripts</H3>

The <A HREF="https://imagemagick.org/script/perl-magick.php"
>PerlMagick</A> API is a good way of conveting "<CODE>convert</CODE>" commands
into a script that can also handle databases, large numbers of images, or more
complex image processing, that is otherwise posible.

The best help is to look at the PerlMagick 'demo' scripts, which is both in
the source, and usually installed in the documentation area of PerlMagick.  On
my system that was in "<CODE>/usr/share/doc/ImageMagick-perl-*/demo/</CODE>".
In this directly are a growing number of simple examples of reading, writing
and processing various images.  Also present is the script "demo.pl" that
lists just about all common Image Processing options, and how you can use
them.  </P>

When converting a command line "<CODE>convert</CODE>" command to perl there
are a few things you need to remember. </P>

<UL>
<LI>First thing to remember is that PerlMagick does not automatically delete
    images new images that were processed. many operators create a new
    modified image from the old image, while others directly modify an
    existing image. </P>

<LI>Also many operators will not apply a specific operation to a whole list of
    images, but only the first image in the list you give it.  This mean you
    will need to loop though the image sequence (perl array) itself.
    </P>

<LI>You can have many image sequences. In fact you typically read every image
    into its own separate image sequence, rather than having to make do with
    a single image sequence, as is the case on the command line. </P>

<LI>Also once you have the image in memory you can easilly extract the size of
    the existing image.  That means you can just create new canvases without
    needing to clone and clear an existing image as you do on the command
    line.  However cloning an image also copies an images meta-data, so you
    may like to keep track of that meta-data for images such as digital
    photos. </P>

<LI>Check for image errors (as shown on the  <A
    HREF="https://imagemagick.org/script/perl-magick.php" >PerlMagick</A>
    page) after every major process, especially when reading images.

</UL></P>

To magick a command line into perl, you would basically do the exact same
operations, in the exact same sequence.  However as images are generally not
deleted, and multiple image sequences are common, the use of parenthesis, and
extra cloning operations in "<CODE>convert</CODE>" commands are usally not
an issue.  </P>

The hardest part in converting scripts is usually mapping a command line option
to a PerlMagick function call.  The fastest way I found is to get the source
code of IM and look at the file "<CODE>wand/mogrify.c</CODE>" and search for
the specific command line option you are having trouble with. </P>

For example for say the <CODE>-threshold</CODE> option search for
<CODE>"threshold"</CODE> including the quotes.  Their will be two matches, one
for a quick syntax parse to make sure all the options are found, and the second
with the actual internal calls for that option.  Here you will find the name of
the library function used, and that will usally directly map to the Perl
function.  In this case...  <CODE>BilevelImageChannel()</CODE> </P>


<HR><!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<A NAME="security"></A>
<H2>Security Warnings</H2>

When writing a script for public use, especially a web-based PHP script where
ANYONE in the world could be running it, it is vitally important to check
everything that could posibly have come from an unknown (or even a known) user.
And I mean <B>EVERYTHING</B>, from arguments, filenames, URLs, and images too.
</P>

Until you verify some input argument, that argument it could contains letters,
numbers, spaces, punctuation, or even 'null' and control characters.  Untill
you have throughly checked it, it should be treated as suspect and should not
be used. </P>

It does not matter that you are using some web controlled input form. A
slightly knowledgeable person can easily call your PHP with his own arguments
without using that input form at all.  An don't believe they won't do it,
robots are out there, reading input forms and creating there own 'hacked'
arguments to try an break into random scripts.  </P>

<A NAME="globbing"></A>
<H3>Meta-characters in file names</H3>

As a security issue, you should especially watch out for, are filenames that
contain spaces, quotes, punctuation, control-characters, or other
meta-characters as both IM and Shells may try to expand them. </P>

The problem is that a file called  '<CODE>*?@${&) .jpg</CODE>'  is actually
a perfectly legal filename under UNIX, but a LOT of programs will have trouble
handling it if that program (like both shell and IM) also do filename
expansion. </P>

Remember even if you prevent the shell from going 'glob' meta-characters
expandsion, IM itself also does this expansion (for DOS usage).  As such
preventing all such characters (and producing an error), is probably a wise
thing to do. </P>

As a security measure it is often a good idea to error and abort if a filename
has ANY unknown or unusual characters in it, anything that is say not letters,
numbers, or in the expected suffix.  Before passing such a filename to a shell
command, or IM.  It is better to be a LOT more restrictive and prevent things,
than be permissive and allowing something bad through. </P>


<HR><!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<A NAME="scripts"></A>
<H2>Hints for Better ImageMagick Shell/PHP Scripts</H2>

These were some basic script programming points I made about a contributed
shell script that was sent to the IM mail list for others to use. I originally
sent these to the author privately (and who will remain anonymous), for which
he was grateful.

They are not all IM specific, but should be applied anyway, as standard
programming practice.  Especially if you plan to have someone else, use, look
at, and/or bug fix your program or script. It will in turn make your script
more useful. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Place the 'help' or 'doc' at the top of scripts and programs.  </P>

    This makes it lot easier for other people to figure out what a particular
    program does without needing to install or run the script.  I myself will
    often junk a program that has no such clear comment on what it is for
    rather than try to compile or run such an unknown script. </P>

    In fact I have seen huge projects where the first README file does not
    even say what the huge and complex project does!  The programmer just
    assumes that if you downloaded it you must know what it does! </P>

    Also make sure that a 'bad option' such as '-?' will print a synopsis of
    not just the options, but also a quick summery of what the program does,
    or where to find such help.  Do not just point to a remote web site, that
    may disappear 10 years down the track! </P>

    For an example of a script that prints its own 'opening comments' see the
    "<A HREF="../scripts/jigsaw" >jigsaw</A>" script in the IM <A
    HREF="../scripts/" >scripts</A> area. </P>

    Perl can use POD for self documentation (See the perl
    "<CODE>Pod::Usage</CODE>" module). For example see the contributed <A
    HREF="../scripts/dpx_timecode.pl" >dpx_timecode.pl</A> script. </P>

    Having the help as a 'here file' in the first sub-routine is also
    acceptable, and works for most languages. But have that subroutine AT THE
    TOP, not at the bottom or middle of the script or program.
    </P>

<LI>Make sure you clean up your code, remove old obsolete code and comments,
    making things as neat an tidy as you can.  Be concise, with simply
    commented stages (if possible). </P>

    Again see the "<A HREF="../scripts/jigsaw" >jigsaw</A>" script. </P>

<LI>Make sure temporary files are cleaned up at the end. </P>

    Use a "trap" shell command to remove them on file exit or interrupt.
    You can of course re-use a single temporary files multiple times, so you
    don't need very many, especially with IM v6 magick commands. </P>

    Again see the "<A HREF="../scripts/jigsaw" >jigsaw</A>" script, and search
    for "trap". </P>

<LI>Also not everyone uses system X, though it may seem like that to you.
    Don't refer to specific system requirements, or methods on rectifying the
    problem.  What works for you may be completely in-appropriate for their
    system and setup.  They may not even have Internet access! </P>

    Just say that the "<CODE>convert</CODE>" command from ImageMagick, was not
    found.

    If you want add installation requirements, or suggestions, add it as
    part of separate more extensive documentation. </P>

<A NAME="version"></A>
<LI>Do check that the IM being used is a high enough version, or add backward
    compatible changes.  I purposefully give 'version warning' notes
    throughout
    IM examples as to when various special features were added for this
    purpose. It makes it easier when creating scripts with a single minimal
    version check.  </P>

    Here is one simple way you can get a single version number for testing
    purposes in a shell script.  It extracts the 4 version numbers, and
    inserts the right number of zeros to make each number 2 digits, producing
    a simple 8 digit number.

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
    IM_VERSION=`magick -list configure | \
         sed '/^LIB_VERSION_NUMBER /!d;
              s//,/;  s/,/,0/g;
              s/,0*\([0-9][0-9]\)/\1/g'`
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

    For example IM v6.3.5-10  will generate "<CODE>06030510</CODE>" while
    the very next release IM v6.3.6.0  produces "<CODE>06030600</CODE>". </P>

    A PHP version of the above is available from <A
    HREF="http://www.rubblewebs.co.uk/imagemagick/server/fonts.php"
    >RubbleWeb, Font List</A> examples page. </P>

    The resulting string can be tested, using either a simple numeric or
    string test, to discover if the available ImageMagick version is modern
    enough for what your script is trying to do.  For example...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
    if [ "$IM_VERSION" -lt '06030600' ]; then
      echo &gt;&amp;2 "The perspective distortion operator is not available."
      echo &gt;&amp;2 "Sorry your installed ImageMagick is too old -- ABORTING"
      exit 10
    fi
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

    Also note how I output the exact reason for the abort to the user, and
    specifically the special feature(s) the version check was for.  Otherwise
    you may later forget why that specific version (or higher) was needed.
    </P>

    You can also modify the behaviour of IM for specific versions. </P>

    For example say I want to get a list of available fonts.  Before IM
    version v6.3.5-7 the "<CODE><A HREF="../option_link.cgi?list"
    >-list</A></CODE>" setting "<CODE>type</CODE>" returned the 'known font'
    list.  With later versions, you need to use "<CODE>font</CODE>" setting
    instead.   So here I can do a version check to use the right setting to
    get the information needed.

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
    if [ "$IM_VERSION" -lt '06030507' ];
    then font_list="type";
    else font_list="font";
    fi
    avail_fonts=`magick -list $font_list | cut -d\  -f1 |\
                    egrep -v '^($|----|Path:|Name$)'`
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

    WARNING: a string starting with '0' in PERL could be interpreted as being
    an octal number!!!   However comparing two octal numbers will still come
    out correct, as long as the first digit remains '0'.  Caution, and
    checking of the version test is advised. </P>

    Another alternative for testing the version is to use "<CODE>expr</CODE>"
    instead of the "<CODE>[</CODE>' test...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
    if  expr + "$im_version" \&gt;= "06030507" &gt;/dev/null; then
       ...
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

    WARNING: The extra '<CODE>+</CODE>' in the above is normally not needed,
    at least for this test, but is needed if the variable could contain the
    special keyword '<CODE>match</CODE>" which would give "<CODE>expr</CODE>"
    problems, especially if it is being used for string or sub-string work.
    </P>


<LI>You can also make use of the "<CODE><A HREF="../option_link.cgi?list"
    >-list</A></CODE>" information output to check if some special feature
    has been added to the currently installed ImageMagick.

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
    magick -list distort | grep 'Arc' &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
    if [ "$?" -ne 0 ];  then
      echo &gt;&amp;2 "Arc distortion method not available."
      echo &gt;&amp;2 "Sorry your installed ImageMagick is too old -- ABORTING"
      exit 10
    fi
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

    However be warned that often a new method, like "<CODE><A
    HREF="../option_link.cgi?distort" >-distort</A> Arc</CODE>" could appear
    during IM development before it is properly ready for general use.  As
    such a version check may still be the better idea. </P>

    This is why in IM Examples I try to note (look for <IMG
    SRC="../img_www/warning.gif"  WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=28> symbols) the IM version
    when a new feature have become stable enough for general use. </P>


<LI>Don't use very very long single lines. Especially for complex 'convert'
    commands.  Split them up using line-continuation methods (shown above),
    such as '<CODE>\</CODE>' in UNIX, '<CODE>^</CODE>' in DOS, and
    '<CODE>.</CODE>' string concatenation in PHP. </P>

    However I do not mean placing each and EVERY setting and operation on a
    separate line.  Do one major operation or stage per line, create new
    image, modify image, merge with other images, etc.  Place all operational
    settings needed for a specific operator just before that operator.  Think
    of each line as single processing step. </P>

    This lets you separate the lines so as to allow for the easier reading,
    and understanding of individual processing steps.  The clearer the
    separation of operators, the easier a complex image process is to follow.
    </P>

    Using extra <A HREF="../basics/#parenthesis" >parenthesis</A>, indenting
    the lines over various stages, or even add empty lines between large
    processing blocks,  can make it even easier to see the major stages of
    large and long operation.  </P>

    I use these techniques all over IM examples, so as to make the examples
    easier to follow and understand, so just look around!  </P>

    Finally extra comments about what a specific command is doing can make a
    big difference in someone else (or even yourself 2 months later) reading
    and understanding your script. </P>

    Shame you can not currently insert comments in a long command line! </P>


<LI>Try not to rely on too many external programs, or only use them only if
    they are available (with possible alternatives).  Other people probably
    will not have that program, or prefer to use something else.  If a program
    use can be optional, make it optional, either under user control, or
    automatic use if found.  Try not make it a forced requirement, if at all
    possible.  </P>

    For example you could make use of "<CODE>pngcrush</CODE>",
    "<CODE>optipng</CODE>", "<CODE>pngnq</CODE>" to compress PNG better than
    IM would normally provide (IM is designed to be general not specific).
    Also "<CODE>gifsicle</CODE>", "<CODE>intergif</CODE>", or other for LZW
    compression optimizers for GIF animations, have good and bad points. Just
    don't make it a definite requirement for a script to work.  </P>

    As a practical example, an older version of the "<A
    HREF="../scripts/gif2anim" >gif2anim</A>" did not use the ImageMagick
    "<CODE>identify</CODE>" to look up GIF specific meta-data, but relied on a
    patched version of "<CODE><A
    HREF="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/software/#giftrans"
    >giftrans</A></CODE>".  This requirement was later not needed due to
    improvements in  the ImageMagick "<CODE>identify</CODE>", so I removed
    that requirement to make the script more widely usable. </P>

    ImageMagick itself has a LOT of optional requirements, such as
    "<CODE>ghostscript</CODE>" for postscript and PDF document reading, or the
    "<CODE>librsvg</CODE>" for correct handling of SVG vector images.  IM will
    work quite happily when available. IM treats these libraries as optional,
    only needed them if you want to process images of those formats.  </P>

    Here is a code snippet you can use to check for script dependencies
    (especially usful in a very minimal cygwin environment)...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
  # Check Dependencies to scripts correct working
  DEPENDENCIES="sed awk grep tr bc magick identify"  # adjust to suit

  for i in $DEPENDENCIES; do
    type $i &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 ||
      Usage "Required program dependency \"$i\" missing"
  done
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

<LI>Taking the last point further.  If you need floating point math in a shell
    script that is using IM, you can use IM itself to do that math, rather
    than relying on some other program such as '<CODE>awk</CODE>' or
    '<CODE>bc</CODE>', that may not be available (especially under cygwin on
    windows).  </P>

    For example here we get calculate the sin() of a specific angle given in
    degrees using '<CODE>convert</CODE>' to do the work...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE>
  angle=-20
  sine=`magick xc: -format "%[fx:sin( $angle *pi/180)]" info:`
  echo $sine
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

   The above would output the value '<CODE>-0.34202</CODE>'.  You can adjust
   the number of decimal places using the <A HREF="../basics/#precision"
   >Precision Operational Control</A>. By default it is set to 6 digits.</P>


<LI>Let the user decide on the input/output image formats to use. </P>

    ImageMagick is primarily an image converter and able to use lots of
    different formats.  It can output to the screen, postscript, printers, or
    pipe the image into another command for further processing.  Don't limit
    the user to a specific format. </P>

    For example the "<A HREF="../scripts/jigsaw" >jigsaw</A>" and "<A
    HREF="../scripts/gif_anim_montage" >gif_anim_montage</A>" scripts allow
    the user to specify any input or output image.  That way users can
    pipeline images into, or out of, that script, so as to allow further
    processing using other programs and scripts.  </P>

    For example, I often use a command like...
<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
    gif_anim_magick montage animation.miff show:
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV>
    to magick display the result of the script on my magick display screen, rather than save
    it to a file. In fact in many of my scripts if the output is missing it
    defaults to use "show:". </P>

    I did not limit it to input ONLY from a GIF animation file, or limit
    output to just GIF, PNG, or JPEG image formats, but allowed the script to
    read and process any format ImageMagick can handle. </P>

    In fact IM can read from files, pipelines, the current display, or even
    from the World Wide Web using a "<CODE>URL:</CODE>" or
    "<CODE>HTTP:</CODE>" input format.  Don't limit these posibilities, unless
    it becomes a security concern (such as for web use).</P>


<LI>Read input images, and output multiple-images, only ONCE! </P>

    If the user provides a pipeline file name or an URL, you do should not try
    to read those images more than once, or things can go bad.  Use a
    temporary file, cloned images, or "<CODE><A HREF="../files/#mpc"
    >MPC:</A></CODE>" save a copy of the input image,  when you need to refer
    to that image multiple times.  If you can handle a multiple images from
    the pipeline, even better. </P>

    Again see the "<A HREF="../scripts/jigsaw" >jigsaw</A>" script, for an
    example of saving input images into a temporary file, when you are forced
    to process the input image multiple times, or in a different order than
    what the program arguments imply. </P>

</UL></P>

These things basically gives the user using your program more freedom to do
what THEY want rather than what YOU think they want.  Don't limit them or
yourself by making assumptions on what the script will be used for. </P>

PS: My primary expertise is in UNIX script writing, over lots of different
architectures and 'flavors' of UNIX, LINUX, and other UNIX-like systems, with
more than 25 years experience behind me.  I should know what I am talking
about with regard to the above. </P>

<H2>Why do you use multiple "convert" commands</H2>

<DL>
<DT><B>Willem</B> on Wed, 25 Oct 2006 wrote...
<DD><I>
  I was wondering; sometimes I see in your examples you're invoking Convert
  more then once to obtain the desired result.  In general, I would expect
  that invoking magick more then once isn't needed; it should all be possible
  in 1 invocation (but the command would be more complex then). Do you agree
  with this statement? </I></P>
</DL>

I agree totally. </P>

Though before IM version 6 that was actually impossible, as IM at that time
was not designed to do more than one or maybe two operations per command.
However IMv6 should allow you to do all your processing in one single command.
But sadly even that is not always possible. </P>

I use multiple commands for a number possible reasons.  Typically in the
example pages, I do it so I can magick display the intermediate image result, so as
to better demonstrate the intermediate processing stages that are involved.
Later in the same example area I may repeat the process but using a single
command, with perhaps a little more complexity. </P>

As such in principle, yes a single command can do all image processing.  You
are most welcome to combine the image processing techniques all into a single
command.  I do this all the time myself. </P>

The exception to this is in cases where I need to extract information and
later insert that info into the next command.  An example of this is the <A
HREF="../crop/#trim_blur" >Fuzzy Trim</A> technique which requires you to
extract the results of a trim on a blurred copy of the image.  This result is
then used to crop the original image.  I also did this in the update to <A
HREF="../thumbnails/#rounded" >Thumbnail Rounded Corners</A> example, where
I used IM itself to generate a draw command using an images size for the next
command. </P>

However there are <A HREF="../bugs/future/#settings" >proposals</A> that will
allow options to be generated directly from image that have been previously
read into memory. </P>

In scripts, such as the '<A HREF="../scripts/jigsaw" >jigsaw</A>' script (see
Advanced Techniques, <A HREF="../advanced/#jigsaw" >Jigsaw Pieces</A>)
I commonly end up using multiple commands for a different reason -- optional
processing.  This allows various input options provided by the user to select
additional steps in the image processing sequence. So for optional processing
I also use typically use separate commands for each stage of processing. </P>

In such a case a temporary file is basically unavoidable. However I typically
only need at most one or two temporary images, and each step processes the
image back into the same or previous temporary filename, for the next optional
processing step to continue with. </P>

For example process image replacing the source image.
<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE>
  magick /tmp/image1.png ..operations..  /tmp/image1.png </P>
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

In this case a <A HREF="../files/#mpc" >MPC</A> file can speed up the reading
of intermediate files to a near instant in the next processing step, as the
image is simply dumped from memory onto disk, and then 'paged' back in by the
next command.  This avoids the need for IM to format and parse an image file
format, though it does make the temporary file larger as it is simply
uncompressed memory.</P>

Another alternative I use to avoid temporary files is to pipeline the working
image(s) from one shell command (if-then-else-fi or while loop) to another.
This is known as Image Pipelines and is demonstrated in a number of examples.
And example of this is given in <A HREF="../files/#miff_stream" >MIFF Image
Streaming</A>, where multiple images are generated one after another into the
same output pipeline, to be picked up by the next command to merge them all
into the final image. </P>

And finally you may need to change your processing style based on the results
of previous processing steps.  For example in image comparisons, I often need
to discover some information for use in later processing steps, or to change
how the image should be processed in later stages.  Comparing a diagram or
cartoon can require vary different comparision technique to real-life photo
image. </P>

If the use of multiple commands is becoming a problem, perhaps it is time to
go to an API interface such as <B>PerlMagick</B>, where multiple image
sequences can all be held in memory so as to avoid unnecessary disk IO. </P>

<HR><!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<A NAME="speed"></A>
<H2>Making IM Faster (in general)</H2>

There are many ways of making IM work faster.  Here are the most important
aspects to keep in mind.  As you go down the list the speed up becomes
smaller, or requires more complex changes to the IM installation. </P>

<UL>
<LI>IM Q8 (or 8 bits per color value, 3 to 4 bytes per pixel) is a lot faster
    (3 to 4 times faster) than the IM Q16 default, with its higher color
    resolution.  If you don't need a Q16 for your images, perhaps you should
    replace your IM with a Q8 version. </P>

    Be warned however that only using 8 bit internal quality can effect the
    overall image processing as intermediate images loose information. See <A
    HREF="../basics/#hdri" >HDRI</A> for the opposite of this. </P>

<LI>Use a single "<CODE>convert</CODE>" command if possible, so all the
    processing required for a single image.  This saves on initialization,
    having to create temporary files, or pipelines between commands, and even
    the encode/decode to image file formats for those pipelines and disk I/O.
    </P>

    Of course sometimes you still need to use multiple commands, to allow for
    optional image processing steps, such a calculations involving image size,
    colors or even optional processing steps. IMv7 scripting will help in this
    regard. </P>

<LI>Shell scripts are inherently slow. It is interpreted, require multiple
    steps and extra file handling to disk.  This is of course better thanks
    to the new IM v6 option handling, allowing you to do a large number of
    image processing operations in a single command. Even so you can rarely
    can do everything in a single "<CODE>convert</CODE>" command, so you often
    have to use multiple commands to achieve what you want. </P>

    As such an API like perl, ruby, or a PHP magick module is faster as it
    removes the all the interpretation aspects of both the shell, and the IM
    command line API. It also reduces the initialization steps IM goes though
    in reading font and color definations. </P>

<LI>An API also can hold hold all the images, or even multiple lists of
    images, for the lifetime of the program (as long as you have enough memory
    for it). This means you can chop and change what images are being worked
    on, without the need to shuffle and juggle the images, as you do on the
    command line.  </P>

    This is especially usful when you need to also do extra calculations
    basied on previous image processing steps. </P>

<LI>Writing the GIF image file format is slow.  IM has to work hard to color
    reduce (quantize) the colors of an image to fit into the limited colors of
    the file format.  Even then you often need to do extra work to get it
    right, especially for GIF animations.  PNG and JPEG are faster but at a
    cost of size for PNG, and loss of quality for JPEG.  Though really GIF
    images are worse in terms of quality! </P>

<LI>Pre-preparing and caching images such as backgrounds, overlays, frames,
    masks, or pre-generating color look up tables, distortion maps, templates,
    masks, etc.  All these things can make large differences in your
    processing time.  Think about what can be done before hand.  A large
    library of pre-generated images can be a lot faster that trying to create
    the images as needed.  </P>

    See also the use of "<A HREF="../files/#mpc" >MPC:</A>" for intermediate
    and cached images.  These are memory mapped images on disk, and
    essentially have zero read time, but are useless for anything else, or on
    other machines.  They should only be created at the start of a major image
    handling process, and not stored for any length of time as any smallest of
    software or system upgrade will invalidate them and probably case
    Segmentation Faults.. </P>

<LI>Avoid using <A HREF="../transform/#fx" >FX, The Special Effects Image
    Operator</A>, if you can use <A HREF="../compose/#compose" >Alpha
    Composition</A>,  or the simpler <A HREF="../transform/#evaluate"
    >Evaluate, Simple Math Operations</A>, or other techniques instead. </P>

    If you do need to use these, try restricting its use to the smallest image
    possible, or to a single channel of the image (when handling grayscale).
    </P>

<LI>Avoid using large sized <A HREF="../blur/#blur" >Image Blurs</A> when
    a few smaller ones may be faster.  Do some timing tests to see which is
    faster.   The same goes for other <A HREF="../morphology/#intro"
    >Morphology</A> and <A HREF="../morphology/#convolve" >Convolution
    Operators</A> such as Gaussian and Shadow operators. </P>

<LI>Use smaller sub-images, or regions, for complex processing of small areas.
    For example, find and extract the eyes of an person (using regions),
    before masking and recoloring, can result in a huge speed increase than
    processing the full large version of an image. The bigger the difference,
    the bigger the saving. </P>

<LI>When reading large or even a large number of images, it is better to use
    a <A HREF="../files/#read_modifiers" >Read Modifier</A> to resize, or crop
    them immediately after reading each image, thus reducing its overall
    memory requirement. For JPEG, you can use the special '<CODE><A
    HREF="../formats/#jpg_read" >jpeg:size</A></CODE>' library modifier to
    even avoid allocation of the memory. </P>

    This in turn prevents '<A
    HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_(computer_science)" >Disk
    Thrashing</A>' (which makes computers VERY slow). Especially when lots of
    large images are involved, such as when generating  <A
    HREF="../montage/#index" >Montaged Directory Indexed</A>, or other
    multi-image collages. </P>

<LI>For <A HREF="../files/#massive" >Really Massively Large Images</A> that
    have to be processed from disk, it may be better to process them in
    smaller chunks. </P>

<LI>Also for large images...  If you have a Window 64-bit OS, use the 64-bit
    ImageMagick distribution.  It uses a larger address space and can fit
    larger images into memory than 32-bit Windows. </P>

<LI>IM by default uses multiple threads for individual image processing
    operations.  That means a computer with two or more 'cores'
    will generally process images faster than a single CPU machine. </P>

    For large images the OpenMP multi-thread capabilities can produce
    a definite speed advantage as it uses more CPU's to complete the
    individual image processing operations. </P>

    Note that within IM it is only individual image processing operations that
    are parallelized.  So the saving is more with large image processing, and
    not when processing large numbers of images (see next). </P>

<LI>For small images using the IM multi-thread capabilities will not give you
    much of an advantage.  In this case running multiple converts
    simultaneously on different images can produce more through put. </P>

    This may also happen in situations where multiple PHP web requests could
    launch multiple image "convert" commands. </P>

    In either of these situations having multi-threading enabled could be
    highly detrimental due to CPU contention, and it is better to disable
    OpenMP by setting the '<CODE>MAGICK_THREAD_LIMIT</CODE>' environment
    variable to '<CODE>1</CODE>'. </P>

    See IM Forum Discussion <A HREF="../forum_link.cgi?f=2&t=20012&p=79367"
    >Threading slows down 'convert'</A>. </P>

    You may also like to look at <CODE>MAGICK_THROTTLE</CODE> to get
    ImageMagick to relinquish control of the CPU's more often at more
    appropriate points. </P>

<LI>If you are doing lots of small operations on images (such as drawing) try
    not using any color names.  Specify colors using hash colors, such as
    "<CODE>#00AA99</CODE>" or rgb numbers, such as
    "<CODE>rgb(0,160,100)</CODE>", so as to stop IM from having to load the
    color name tables (which is rather large!). </P>

    Also you can try removing or cutting back the system 'font' list
    definition files (from "<CODE>type.xml</CODE>".  Or remove those files
    completely and specify fonts directly by filename instead. </P>

    Basically reduce the loading of the extra configuration information, which
    IM will read and initialise when required for a specific image process.
    So either don't use them or reduce the size and impact of configuration
    files. </P>

<LI>Building ImageMagick as a shared library (the default) can greatly reduce
    load time.  Libraries and coder modules are only loaded as they are needed
    so a dynamic version of IM will not load anything that it doesn't need to
    use during image processing.  Also shared libraries tend to remain
    available so may not need to be reloaded for a second run. </P>

<LI>If you call ImageMagick as part of an Apache module it will also reduce
    startup time, as parts will be loaded once and kept available for multiple
    use, rather than needing re-loading over and over.  This may become more
    practical in the future with a permanently running 'daemon' IM process.

</DIV></P>

Next you should also install development packages for the libraries IM also
needs to build.  The simple way to get the most common ones is to first instal
the Development version of IM, even though we will build a new one to replace
it later.

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >

</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

<DL>
<DT>You should also ensure that the these packages and their dependencies
    (such as jpeg and png development libraries) are also installed:
<DD><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>freetype-devel  ghostscript-devel libwmf-devel
    jasper-devel  lcms-devel  bzip2-devel librsvg2 librsvg2-devel  liblpr-1
    liblqr-1-devel libtool-ltdl-devel autotrace-devel </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DT>Some examples in "ImageMagick examples" also may use programs provided by
    these optional packages and libraries, but these are not needed for
    the built process.
<DD><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>gnuplot autotrace
     </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL></P>

Generally all these packages are optional, but if not installed, then the
'coders' and operators that make use of those libraries may not be built in
automatically.  For example the "<CODE>liblqr</CODE>" module is needed to
enable the <A HREF="../resize/#liquid-rescale" >Liquid Rescale Operator</A>.
</P>

Now download a SRPM (source RPM) package from which to build your binary RPMs.
</P>

OR  build a SRPM from an existing TAR or SVN download using...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">

Note that once you have the SRPM you can build the actual RPM's to install.

<DIV ALIGN=center>

<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >

</DIV></P>

This will create a sub-directory "<CODE>rpmbuild</CODE>" in your home, in
which it will extract the SRPM sources, and build the compiled package RPM
version of the IM. </P>

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=90%><TR VALIGN=top>

</I></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></P>

Now get the just built RPMs from build directory.  This only grabs the
ImageMagick Core and PerlMagick packages, you may like to grab more than just
these two, but that is up to you...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">

<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >

Now you can install the RPM packages you built.  You will need to be root for
this, (see note about the "<CODE>sudo</CODE>" command above)...

<DIV ALIGN=center>

To upgrade an existing installation I generally do this (as root).

<DIV ALIGN=center>

To later remove IM, you can just remove the package, like this (again as
root)...

<DIV ALIGN=center>

Sometimes I just want to completely clean and wipe out all traces of IM from
the system. To do this I first use the previous command to remove the actual
package from the system (a variation is shown below).  I then run the
following remove commands. </P>

NOTE I make no guarantees about this, and I would check the commands
thoroughly
before hand to ensure they don't remove something that it shouldn't.  If it
missed anything, or it removed something it shouldn't, then please let me know
so I can update it.

Warning, other packages may need an IM installed, so if you remove it, I
suggest that you immediately package update your computer system, so it will
again install the original default (and usually quite old) version of
ImageMagick that was supplied for your Linux system.  This generally involves
using a 'GUI Software Update" package or the command "<CODE>yum

often these will already be present, so is not always a problem. </P>

First decide in what sub-directory you want to install your version of IM.
A dedicated directory is the best choice as it mean you only have to delete
that whole directory to remove your installation.  In my case I'll install
into the "apps/im" sub-directory of my home.

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
  export MAGICK_HOME=$HOME/apps/im
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

Now to install a personal version, download, unpack, and change directory into
the ImageMagick Sources.  Then configure it as a 'uninstalled' version.

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
  rm config.status config.log
  nice ./configure --prefix=$MAGICK_HOME --disable-installed \
          --enable-shared --disable-static --without-modules --with-x \
          --without-perl --without-magick-plus-plus --disable-openmp \
          --with-wmf --with-gslib --with-rsvg --with-xml \
          CFLAGS=-Wextra \
          ;
  nice make clean
  nice make
  nice make install
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

It is the "<CODE>--disable-installed</CODE>" with the "<CODE>--prefix</CODE>"
which is important in the above definition.  The other parts disable the
compilation of more optional aspects of your personal version ImageMagick.
Modify them as you like. </P>

Now to use your own installed version, instead of the normal system version
you only need to set the following environment variables.

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
  export MAGICK_HOME=$HOME/apps/im
  export PATH="$MAGICK_HOME/bin:$PATH"
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$MAGICK_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

Now if I type
<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
  magick -version
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

I can see the more up-to-date version of IM you just installed, by default.
</P>

Note that the variable "<CODE>$MAGICK_HOME</CODE>" is required to be set for
an Imagemagick created with a "<CODE>--disable-installed</CODE>" option.  The
other two environment variables ensure that we use the personal version rather
that any system version that may also be installed. </P>

<BR>

<B>WARNING:</B> do not mix the above variables. Either define all of them or
do not have them defined in this way.  The IM executable you use MUST also use
the same libraries, coders, and configuration files that were built with those
executable. Mixing the system and your personal version will likely cause
segmentation and memory faults. </P>

<BR>

You can move the location of your personal IM without re-compiling, but you
will need to not only modify the above environment variables, but also change
(or remove) the hard coded paths to the "<CODE>display</CODE>" program used by
the "<CODE><A HREF="../files/#show" >show:</A></CODE>" delegate in your
personal installed version of the "<CODE>delegate.xml</CODE>" file.  See <A
HREF="../files/#delegates" >Delegates</A> for more information on this aspect
of IM. </P>

<BR>

To make it easy for me to switching between the system installed and multiple
personal versions of IM, I typically do not set the above variables at all.
Instead I call a script that sets those variables before calling the specific
version of IM.  </P>

For example I have a personal version of IM that was compiled with <A
HREF="../basics/#hdri" >HDRI</A>, which I only use for specific examples in
ImageMagick Examples.  I don't normally want to use this version, perfering
the non-HDRI system installed version for most image work. </P>

As such I installed a 'HDRI' version of IM in my personal area
"<CODE>$HOME/apps/im_hdri</CODE>", and created a script I called
"<CODE>hdri</CODE>" containing...

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
#!/bin/sh
#
#   hdri imagemagick_command....
#
# Run the HDRI version of imagemagick (or other personal installed IM)
#
# Where is the HDRI version of IM stored
export MAGICK_HOME=$HOME/apps/im_hdri

# Set the other two environment variables
export PATH="$MAGICK_HOME/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$MAGICK_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

# Execute the HDRI version of the command
exec "$@"
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

Now if I type...
<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE EXECUTE OUT=hdri_version.txt >
  hdri magick -version
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD>
  <A HREF="hdri_version.txt"
     ><IMG SRC="hdri_version.txt.gif"
           ALIGN=middle VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 BORDER=0 ALT="[IM Text]"></A>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

I see that I ran my HDRI quality version of ImageMagick, but only when I need
it.  If I don't prefix "<CODE>hdri</CODE>" to the above, I then I would run
the normal system version of IM. </P>

WARNING: If your personal version of IM is not found by the script, it will
silently revert to using the system version.  The above 'version' check is an
important test to make sure that I am actually using my personal version, and
not the system version. </P>

You can also check exactly which magick command the script is trying to
execute using the 'which'.

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
  hdri which convert
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>

That is the script is flexiable enough that you don't actually need to run
"<CODE>convert</CODE>" but can run any command, such as ImageMagick Shell
Scripts, so that that script uses the HDRI magick instead of the normal system
convert. </P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80% BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC">
<TR><TD><PRE><CODE DO_NOT_EXECUTE >
  hdri  some_im_script   image.png   image_result_hdri.png
</CODE></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
</DIV></P>
